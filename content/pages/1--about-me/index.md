Howdy fellow grease monkey, I’m Johnathan. Thanks for visiting learn diesels!

So I first started working on diesels when I was 18. I got super lucky and landed a mechanic trainee job at southeastern freight lines. 


So, with that dream in mind, I’ve set up this website to support my toy habit while writing about something I am passionate about. My aim is to pass on some tips and advice that I have picked up over the years of wrenching and offer it to you in the form of a helpful, informative and entertaining diesel website. I also like to be able to provide mechanics of all levels from around the world a place to interact.

* I place Google Ads on this site to generate some coin which makes it possible to keep this site moving and grooving. They’re not there to take advantage of you but rather a way to support the site, so thanks for understanding.

I also offer advertising space to diesel related companies so please show your support by checking these guys out. They can be recognized as banner ads and (occasionally) links.

All of the links, products, and companies I recommend on this site are trustworthy and reliable, otherwise, I wouldn’t put them up. If for some reason you do have problems with any of them please email me so I can contact the company, and if necessary remove the link.

I really do hope you enjoy what I’ve put together here. If you have any questions, suggestions, complaints or compliments – fire ’em up! I would love to know how I can improve this site. And if you really have enjoyed browsing through it, please tell me – 


Keep wrenching,

Johnathan
