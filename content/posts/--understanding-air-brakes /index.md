Understanding air-brakes can be difficult. There is a lot going on in the system and it can be overwhelming when you are first getting started and even when you have been at it a while. 

One of the things that is passed up completely when learning is **basic component identification.** With mechanics one of the greatest struggles is just learning what stuff is called. Once you have components down then it's time to figure out how they work. So, in keeping with that, let's look at the basic components of a air-brake system and then get into functions.

**Take a look at this diagram**

### Goals

My hope is by the end of this article that you understand that diagram and can use it to diagnose problems. Please remember this will be a high level overview but, I will provide resources for further study. there is a ton of good resources out there. So, where to start...

1. What stuffs called

- Air Compressor


- Governor

- Safety Valve 

- Primary Air

- Secondary Air

- Brake Chamber, Spring Brake

- QR Valve

- Modulator 

- Brake/Treadle Valve 

- MV Module

- Air Gauge 


## Functions 

- Charging: The system must be pressurized with air before the brakes will release. At rest, the brakes remain engaged. Once the system reaches its operating pressure, the brakes are freed and ready to use.

- Applying: As the brakes are applied, air pressure decreases. As the amount of air decreases, the valve allows air back into the reservoir tanks, while the brakes move to the applied position.

- Releasing: Once the brakes are applied and the air escapes after braking, the increased pressure releases the brakes.
