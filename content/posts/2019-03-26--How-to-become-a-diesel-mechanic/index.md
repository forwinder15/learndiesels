Diesel mechanics are in huge demand. With this demand the wages have been steadly rising. Now is a great time to get into the industry. 

When I first started in the diesel world I had no idea the amount of knowledge I needed to have to be a great mechanic. I only knew that it looked like fun and I enjoyed taking stuff apart ***(with an emphasis on apart not putting back together)*** but, there was no way for me to know the best way to make it happen. That is why I am going to lay it all out there for you! How do you go from bag-boy to diesel tech, waiter to wrencher, zoo keeper to grease monkey...alright thats enough of that. Let's dive in.

# There are many paths...

There are lots of roads to becoming a diesel mechanic and I am going to lay some of the out there for you. 

 

## The school path

A very common question now is *Do you have to go to school to be a diesel mechanic*. The answer, *NO*. Technical school is one path. I have not seen many diesel jobs that a requiring school. Most are looking at experience. But, that doesn't mean school is a bad option. *It's not*. For a lot of people school is a great option. Especially when you are younger and do not already have family responsibilities and are able to support yourself with part time work. There are some great schools out there! Maybe your even thinking of one right now. 

I know when I think of schools [Lincoln Tech Diesel College](https:/www.lincolntech.edu/campus/nashville-tn/programs/diesel-technology) always comes to mind. School is a great way to prepare for a future diesel mechanic job. They are going to teach you the latest in technology and the older stuff that you will likely be working on daily. You will have experienced teachers and one on one training that will enable you to focus. You will learn all about the parts how thing work and will be able to become skilled in diagnostics. You be able to make friends who can help you when your stuck and something and later in life network to find positions.

But, will school land you a job? Will it prepare you and make you qualified for that job? Well the answer...maybe üòÖ. It really depends on you and your ability to sell yourself in an interview. Not in an arrogant "I'm so smart and can fix all the things" sell yourself way but, a confident and **good attitude** towards challenges way. You can learn and be the top of your class in you tech school, finish all the assignments early,be the teacher's pet and never get a job if your attitude stinks. Just because the job says minimum 2 years experience **(which almost all of them do)** doesn't mean the shop won't take a chance on a guy just out of school who was a pleasure to interview and had a great attitude. Having been on both sides of the interview table I can tell you *experience means more than school but, attitude trumps both!* Having a great attitude can make all the difference.  

**It is not our abilities that show what we truly are‚Ä¶ it is our choices. ‚Äì Dumbledore**
 
Overall, I think school is a good route if you have the time and the right attitude. A lot of times these schools will even help with job placement but, these companies can often be in the location of the school so, if you travel for school that's out for you. So go to school! Get started. Time is only wasting away if this is the right option for you.


##The trainee/apprenticeship path

Another great way to break into a diesel mechanic position is to find a mechanic trainee or apprenticeship spot. A lot of companies and local governments are making special job classes for this noe because there are so many vacancies. This is a good route for the self starters out there. 

#What is a apprenticeship
In general, an apprenticeship is working under skilled supervisors and carrying out a variety of tasks while obtaining hands-on knowledge about the trade.

In most cases, an apprenticeship is a paid position, where the apprentice will do those tasks that he or she is suited or **that the skilled mechanic doesn't want to do** üòÜ all while being instructed by their supervisors.

#The experience

This is how I started. I was in the trucking industry and was working on the dock driving a fork-lift. I had a new wife and baby on the way so, school would have been tough. I needed that green stuff. I just waited until the shop had an opening and went down and talked to the the shop manager and away I went. It was not a bump free path. There are lots of holes to fill when you are trained this way.

The struggle is real for the mechanic trainee. Once you are taught something you are then expected to know that thing for eternity. In many cases there are evaluations on a monthly basis and your skills are put to the test on jobs by yourself. There is a certain amount of stress that goes with all this and can be difficult if you have a hard time under pressure. But, it also depends o the culture of the particular shop you get a job in.

In My experience this is pretty close. maybe a higher Depending on where you live and certifications your have.
