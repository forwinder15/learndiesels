## "The secret of getting ahead is getting started." - ***Mark Twain*** 

Diesel mechanics are in uge demand. With this demand the wages have been steadly rising. Now is a great time to get into the industry. When I first started in the diesel world I had no idea the amount of knowledge I needed to have to be a great mechanic. I only knew that it looked like fun and I enjoyed taking stuff apart ***(with an emphasis on apart not putting back together)*** but, there was no way for me to know the best way to make it happen. That is why I am going to lay it all out there for you! How do you go from bag-boy to diesel tech, waiter to wrencher, zoo keeper to grease monkey...alright thats enough of that. Let's dive in. 

# There are many paths frodo.

There are lots of roads to becoming a diesel mechanic and I am going to lay some of the out there for you. 

 

## The school route

A very common question now is *Do you have to go to school to be a diesel mechanic*. The answer, *NO*. Technical school is one path. I have not seen many diesel jobs that a requiring school. Most are looking at experience. But, that doesn't mean school is a bad option. *It's not*. For a lot of people school is a great option. Especially when you are younger and do not already have family responsibilities and are able to support yourself with part time work. There are some great schools out there! Maybe your even thinking of one right now. 

I know when I think of schools [Lincoln Tech Diesel College](https:/www.lincolntech.edu/campus/nashville-tn/programs/diesel-technology) always comes to mind. School is a great way to prepare for a future diesel mechanic job. They are going to teach you the latest in technology and the older stuff that you will likely be working on daily. You will have experienced teachers and one on one training that will enable you to focus. You will learn all about the parts how thing work and will be able to become skilled in diagnostics. You be able to make friends who can help you when your stuck and something and later in life network to find positions.

But, will school land you a job? Will it prepare you and make you qualified for that job? Well the answer...maybe üòÖ. It really depends on you and your ability to sell yourself in an interview. Not in an arrogant "I am so smart and can fix all the things" sell yourself way but, a confident and **good attitude** towards challenges way. You can learn and be the top of your class in you tech school, finish all the assignments early,be the teacher's pet and never get a job if your attitude stinks. Just because the job says minimum 2 years experience **(which almost all of them do)** doesn't mean the shop won't take a chance on a guy just out of school who was a pleasure to interview and had a great attitude. Having been on both sides of the interview table I can tell you *experience means more than school but, attitude trumps both!* Having a great attitude can make all the difference.  

**It is not our abilities that show what we truly are‚Ä¶ it is our choices. ‚Äì Dumbledore**
 
Overall, I think school is a good route if you have the time and the right attitude. A lot of times these schools will even help with job placement but, these companies can often be in the location of the school so, if you travel for school that's out for you. So go to school! Get started. Time is only wasting away if this is the right option for you.


##The trainee/apprenticeship route

Another great way to break into a diesel mechanic position is to find a mechanic trainee or apprenticeship spot. A lot of companies and local governments are making special job classes for this noe because there are so many vacancies. This is a good route for the self starters out there.
