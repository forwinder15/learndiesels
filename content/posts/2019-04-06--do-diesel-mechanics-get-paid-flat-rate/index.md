Flat rate work stinks. O, wait... let me tell you what flat rate is first. 

Flat rate pay is when a mechanic is paid by the number of hours **billed** (or book hours) to a job regardless of how long it takes them. Most people in the industry agree that flat rate pay is a huge rip off for the mechanic. Before I go on a rant let me answer the question.

**No. Most diesel mechanics are payed hourly. There may be exceptions but, the majority are not flat rate. Flat rate is usually at dealerships and other small "car" shops. Let's look at why flat rate sucks and why you should never work anywhere that has that pay structure.**

2. Favoritism

If you looked at this article and thought "whatever I think it's great" it's because you are the lucky onw who gets all the high paying jobs. We talk about you behind your back. I'm sure you just love the service manager that much that you buy his lunch daily. 

Favoritism is one of the big problems with flat rate. Who gets the best paying jobs? The best mechanic? The one with the most seniority? In some cases but, more often the guy who is in with the boss. While the new guy is struggling to get 30 paid hours the other guy is racking up 80.
