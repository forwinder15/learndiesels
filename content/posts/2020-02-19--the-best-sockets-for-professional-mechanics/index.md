As a profession mechanic your sockets are important. You should invest in some good ones. Let's break down what makes a good socket and then look at a couple of good options to add to your toolbox. 

We are going to use **Standard 6 point 3/8 socket sets** as our baseline in this list. You can bet if this set is good the 12 point and 1/4 and 1/2 will be the same.


##What makes a good socket?
 
###Durability 

This is possibly the most important feature in a good socket. As a pro you need a socket that is going to last. The last thing you want is cracking or wear making the socket not fit right.

###Accurate sizing

That Chinese set you bought may have been cheap but sometimes you get what you pay for. Take the time to find sockets that are sized correctly 

###Finish 

Different finishes will translate to different wear and usability. 

###Thickness

This will not only make a huge difference in wear it will also make it more or less difficult to get in to tight areas depending on the thickness

###Warranty 

Almost all tools now-a-days will proclaim their lifetime warranty but it is important to note that not all are **hassle free.** I will note in each tool how good the process is. Some will do an instant swap out and some will require you to mail them in.


##List disclaimer 

This list is based on value for the money. You may see some that surprise you but remember this list is compiled to give you the best socket for the money. So don‚Äôt get upset when snap-on isn‚Äôt number 1. üòÜ


##1. SK Professional Tools 4613 13-Piece 3/8 in. Drive 6-Point Standard Socket Set

![sk](./sock.png)

Best tools for the money? The survey says SK! SK has been around a long time and they have hung around for a reason. Their stuff lasts! 

Don't believe ask around your shop or buddies and just see how many guys have them. They are very popular and are made with a pro in mind. I would not recommend their ratchet but their sockets are great.

They take pride in the technology that goes into the sockets and the durability they get from them. For the longest time I only had SK impact sockets but since I have had their chrome set I have not looked back. I give these things a hard way to go and they are hanging in there.


Plus the warranty is a breeze. Had a couple broken impact sockets took no time to get them replaced.

##2. Gearwrench 80552 14 Pc. 3/8" Drive 6 Point Metric Standard Socket Set

![gear](./gwsoc.png)

Gear wrench has to be one of the more underrated tool manufacturers. How often are your replacing those ratchet wrenches? Never. I use their ratchets exclusively. check out my [best ratchet for pros blog](/the-best-ratchet-for-professional-mechanics). You will see that video that shows just how strong they are!

This set of sockets is durable, accurate and even a bit thinner profile then others. Its a great choice on a budget and not a bad choice overall. As long as you don't abuse them they will last you a very long time.

##3. Blue Point 11pc 3/8" SAE Shallow Socket Set 6pt 1/4"-7/8"

![blue](./blue.png)

Ahh the old Snap-on knock off. Blue point really is a decent tool. I have several in my set and they have held up to loads of torture. If you need a great set of sockets and have a few bucks extra but not the whole mint then blue point is your best bet.

They come with the same Snap-on warranty and convenience if the truck is stopping by your shop already with about 25% off the price tag. You can't go wrong here it really is just a matter of finding it at a workable amount.

You will find the price varies. Blue point is on Amazon every once in a while and Ebay. This will save you a ton if you plan on buying them on the truck. Have a look around the old inter-webs first.

##4. Snap-on 211FSY 11pc 3/8" SAE Shallow Socket Set 6pt 1/4"-7/8"

![snap](./snapp.png)

The only reason this snap-on set is not at the top of the list is price. They make very good tools. No one questions this. Is it worth the 300% higher price than other tools? Doubtful. 

This set is great and the only way I recommend buying it is off Ebay. Above is a link to a eBay set for around 120 bucks. Check it out. If it's not still there, there are always sets around. 

One thing to note is if you haven‚Äôt bought anything from your Snap-on guy they don‚Äôt like to warranty stuff. I have been told by some that they won‚Äôt replace tools they didn‚Äôt sell. But not all are jerks lie that.

![crap](./crapman.png)

So last and least. This Craftsman set has been used in shops. I have seen a couple guys give them a shot. Some lasted quite a while. 

You can save some bucks here and the warranty is great. So if money is tight üí∏ This may be your set. You could do worse. They are at least made in the USA.
