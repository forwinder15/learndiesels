As a profession mechanic your sockets are important. You should invest in some good ones. Let's break down what makes a good socket and then look at a couple of good options to add to your toolbox. 

We are going to use **Standard 6 point 3/8 socket sets** as our baseline in this list. You can bet if this set is good the 12 point and 1/4 and 1/2 will be the same.


##What makes a good socket?
 
###Durability 

This is possibly the most important feature in a good socket. As a pro you need a socket that is going to last. The last thing you want is cracking or wear making the socket not fit right.

###Accurate sizing

That Chinese set you bought may have been cheap but sometimes you get what you pay for. Take the time to find sockets that are sized correctly 

###Finish 

Different finishes will translate to different wear and usability. 

###Thickness

This will not only make a huge difference in wear it will also make it more or less difficult to get in to tight areas depending on the thickness

###Warranty 

Almost all tools now-a-days will proclaim their lifetime warranty but it is important to note that not all are **hassle free.** I will note in each tool how good the process is. Some will do an instant swap out and some will require you to mail them in.


##List disclaimer 

This list is based on value for the money. You may see some that surprise you but remember this list is compiled to give you the best socket for the money. So don‚Äôt get upset when snap-on isn‚Äôt number 1. üòÜ

![snap](./snapp.png)

The only reason this snap-on set is not at the top of the list is price. They make very good tools. No one questions this. Is it worth the 300% higher price than other tools? Doubtful. 

This set is great and the only way I recommend buying it is off Ebay. Above is a link to a eBay set for around 120 bucks. Check it out. If it's not still there, there are always sets around. 

One thing to note is if you haven‚Äôt bought anything from your Snap-on guy they don‚Äôt like to warranty stuff. I have been told by some that they won‚Äôt replace tools they didn‚Äôt sell. But not all are jerks lie that.

##Summing up
