As a profession mechanic your toolbox is important. You should invest in a good one. Let's break down what makes a good toolbox and then look at a couple of good options to aid you in your search. 


##What makes a good toolbox?
 
### Durability 

This is possibly the most important feature in a good toolbox. As a pro you need a box that is going to last. The last thing you want drawlers falling out after 6 months.

The main thing that kills chrome sockets is using them in an impact. Chrome sockets are made for hand tools and will last a long way if used properly. 

### Security 

That Chinese box you bought may have been cheap but sometimes you get what you pay for. If a flathead can be used in lou of a key this is not good. Beware if your box is in a high traffic area you need to pay attention to the security of your toolbox.

### Dimensions 

It need to fit in your spot. Also you need anough space to store that massive collection of yours. 

### Max Load 

You need to know how many pounds or kgs you can stuff in there before it starts to buckle. Tools get heavy quick. 

### Warranty 

Almost all tools now-a-days will proclaim their limited lifetime warranty but it is important to note that not all are **hassle free.** I will note in each toolbox how good the process is.


## List disclaimer 

This list is based on value for the money. You may see some that surprise you but remember this list is compiled to give you the best socket for the money. So don‚Äôt get upset when snap-on isn‚Äôt number 1. üòÜ

## Toolbox Set-up and Maintenance

Once you have invested all that money into your tools, you need a plan to take care of them and organize them. You need to keep your tools in great condition, so they work great. Ever tried to open a pair of rusted pliers? No fun. Likewise, when your favorite ratchet is missing you are not a happy camper üèïÔ∏è

# Overloading you drawlers.

It really doesn't matter what box you buy. If you go way over the max load of your drawlers you are going to have problems.
