Snap-on makes some great tool boxes and because they are made well they can be very heavy. I personally owned the Classic 96 72" and full of tools that sucker was a beast.

**The average weight of an empty Snap-on toolbox is 876 Pounds. The specific weight depends on the model and series of the toolbox you have. The lightest full size box is 349 pounds and the heaviest is 1,970 pounds.**

Below üëá is a helpful table for Full Size Roll Cabs. I scoured [Snap-on's website](https://shop.snapon.com/categories/629047)
to find you all the weights and put them in the chart below. I hope it helps you and provides the info you need.

## Explanation of Catagories

### 1. Toolbox series

This is the series and model of the you specific tool chest. Snap has 4 different series in full size boxes.

1. Classic Series
2. Heritage Series
3. Masters Series
4. EPIQ Series

Snap-on made these series to give you options in pricing. Each series has its pros and cons and is quality based on value for money. The classic and Heritage Series are the lower tier Boxes and the Masters and EPIQ are the higher tiers. They have different options and features based on the one you have.

### 2. Width/Number of Banks

This is simply the width of the box and the number of banks. The banks are the drawers divided by the sides. You may have a single, double or triple bank box.

### 3. Empty weight

This is the weight of the box with nothing in it at all. Easy enough.

### 4. Max Loaded Weight

This is the weight of the box plus the highest amount Snap-on recommends it can hold. If Snap-on recommends 3000 lbs and the weight of the box is 500 lbs then the Max Loaded Weight of that box would be 3500 pounds.
